# tinyTurtle
tinyTurtle is a low-cost open-source robotic platform running on tinyML and microROS. This was developed to provide an alternative to expensive gears for those pursuing mobile robotics with limited resources [ like me! ].  It was primarily dedicated for robot swarm, mapping &amp; navigation.
