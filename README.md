tinyTurtle is a low-cost open-source robotic platform running on tinyML and microROS. This was developed to provide an alternative to expensive gears for those pursuing mobile robotics with limited resources [like me!]. It was primarily dedicated for robot swarm, mapping & navigation.

Firstly, **do not** think of this project as a guide; it's rather an open journal. The project is something I am exploring myself and sharing my findings as I go. You can use all the resources available here and do as you like and/or even better you can contribute to this project to make it much better, which I highly encourage. That being said, there are two ways you can get along:

1. You could follow me as I go along sharing my projects, which is not recommended as my interests are, in a word, "capricious" and may not be what you intend to do. Furthermore, following me would be quite time intensive as at the time of writing this I am working on two gigs so I can barely manage time for regular updates on a hobby project. However, if you just want to learn with no specific goal in a chill pace, you are welcome to follow me. _OR_
  
2. You could use the resources to build your own projects, help those having similar issues and and contribute to the overall open-source/open-journal nature of this repo, which I highly recommend. You are open to let me know of my mistakes as well. Let's improve together, eh?
